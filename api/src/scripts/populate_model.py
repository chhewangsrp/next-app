I'm a software engineer with roots tracing back to Nepal. In 2018, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from The City College of New York, 
marking the beginning of my journey. My leap of faith led me to pursue education and opportunity in the United States. 
Since then, I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of coding, where every line is a chance to innovate and problem-solve. 
Off-screen, you'll find me on the soccer field or lost in the melodies of music, cherishing life's diverse experiences with boundless enthusiasm.
